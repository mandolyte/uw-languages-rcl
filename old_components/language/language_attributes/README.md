### Simple example

This is a component that shows the attributes for a single language.
In the example shown, the language code is `aaa`.

*NOTE: there is code that checks for an undefined language code, which returns the string "unk" for all attribute values, except for the input language code.*

```js
<LanguageAttributes lc='aaa' />
```
